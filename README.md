# hexalog
Hexalog implements a consensus protocol in a peer-to-peer system leveraging the underlying
overlay network.  Hexalog is unique in that it does not have a dedicated master or a
leader-follower setup.  Instead peers participating in the cluster, responsible for the
key vote amongst themselves to come to a consensus.
